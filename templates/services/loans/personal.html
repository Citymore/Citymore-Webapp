  <h1>About Personal Loan</h1>
  <div class="jumbotron" style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif; font-size:1.3em;">
    Personal loans and depository relationships are very attractive for community banks/financial institutions. The businesses provide the lender and the customer with mutual advantage which include attractive pricing and terms for the professional practice and for the bank a historically stable borrower with multiple depository relationships, goods balances, and lower risk loans.

Many professionals continue to rely on the large financial institutions and private brokers throughout the country, but it is my belief that once you work with a local community bank, you will see the hands on service, the community of knowing who to talk to and who will get the job done for you. This many times come with more flexibility and better pricing than you may see at large institutions.

Representatives of banks, credit unions and other financial institutions that find and assists borrowers in acquiring loans. Some specialized loan officers, called loan underwriters, analyze and assess the credit worthiness of potential borrowers to see if they qualify for a loan. Loan officers usually work on either consumer or mortgage loans.
